# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview of the Analysis
The goal for this project was to group cryptocurrencies on the trading market for the Accountability Accounting Advisory Services Team's investment portfolio.  They will use this portfolio to offer new cryptocurrencies to their customers.  In order to accomplish this analysis, 4 parts needed completed.  Part 1: preprocess the data using PCA, Part 2: reducing data dimensions using PCA, Part 3: clustering cryptocurrencies using the K-means algorithm, and Part 4 was to visualize the cryptocurrency results to present to the board. Below I've included screenshots of the visualizations.
